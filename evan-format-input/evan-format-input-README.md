The data was last downloaded from Google Drive - Summer 2024-Labeling - Evan - Evan Summer Labeling Assignment 1-5 submission Perfect (respectively). 

# Update 2024-08-21
* Added data from Evan Summer Labeling 6 submission Perfect and AllEvanPerfect (Spring 2024 labeled data). 
* Data from pilot sessions (01_21_2021) were all removed. (Team_ID should be NA in these sheets). 
* Please note: 02_25_2021_vero #3_team_round 1 and 3 are missing. So I have removed round 2 for now. 

As of now:  138 sheets, 46 teams. 

# Update 2024-09-04
* The first two rows in 05_13_2021_vero #7_round 2_otter.ai_made_perfect.csv contained NA, which I then manually removed.
* Due to an issue in the origianl sheet (03_06_2021PM_vero #7_team_round3_otter.ai_made_perfect.csv), the output of Team_ID 2_7_8 in Round 3 would have Round_Number as NA. I have manually corrected the Round column in the output statistics to 3.
