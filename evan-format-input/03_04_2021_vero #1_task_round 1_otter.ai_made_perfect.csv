However, due to mechanical difficulties, your ship was forced to land at a spot some 200 miles from the rendezvous point. during reentry and landing much of the equipment aboard was damaged and since survival depends on reaching the mothership, the most critical items available must be chosen for the 200 mile trip below are listed are listed the 15 items left intact and on damage after landing. Their task is to rank order them in terms of their importance for your crew and allowing them to reach the rendezvous point place the number one buy the most important item number two second most important etc, etc. You may assume one the number of crew members is the same as the number in your team.
