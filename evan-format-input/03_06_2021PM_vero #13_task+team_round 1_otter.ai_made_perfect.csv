And since survival depends on reaching the mother ship, the most critical items available must be chosen for the 200 mile trip. Below are 15 items left intact and I'm damaged Your task is to rank them in terms of their importance for your crew and allowing them to reach the rendezvous point, place the number one but the most important number two, so on and so forth.
