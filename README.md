STRONG project SNA analysis, including data and pre-processing procedures. Created in summer 2024. 

This directory is organized following the guidelines suggested by Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014). Gentzkow, Matthew and Jesse M. Shapiro. 2014. Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitionerâ€™s Guide. University of Chicago mimeo,

File directories in scripts have been renamed using here package to improve portability. 

TODO: 
1. Consider streamlining data cleaning process for each sheet. Currently we use bash to perform the cleaning one sheet at a time. May consider using Quarto interactive report later. 
2. Create rundirectory.bat for complete reproducibility.
